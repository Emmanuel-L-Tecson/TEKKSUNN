# About
I am currently a senior highschool student. I aspire to be job-ready and have already made a lot of money before I graduate. Plan to finish CS50x, The Odin Project's Curriculum (both NodeJS and Ruby on Rails Path), and enroll and finish a Cybersecurity Online Course (hopefully free, and from Google).
